# Spatial Analysis Assignments Repository

This repository showcases a collection of class projects completed during GIS courses completed at the University of Toronto Scarborough and contains a variety of projects that cover a range of statistical methods and spatial data analysis techniques. These projects were part of our coursework, designed to enhance our skills in data analysis and visualization. 

## Explanation of Statistical Methods

Here are concise explanations of each statistical method used:

### Simple Linear Regression
- Models the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Seeks to find a linear equation that best fits the data.

### Multiple Linear Regression
- Extends simple linear regression to include multiple predictor variables.
- Examines how different factors simultaneously influence the dependent variable.

### Binary Logistic Regression
- Used when the outcome is binary (yes/no, 1/0).
- Models the relationship between a binary dependent variable and independent variables.

### Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Appropriate when the outcome has more than two categories.
- Models the probability of each category relative to a reference category.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving important information.
- Creates uncorrelated variables known as principal components.

### Factor Analysis
- Identifies latent factors explaining correlations among observed variables.
- Simplifies complex datasets by representing them with a smaller number of factors.

### Cluster Analysis
- Groups similar data points together based on characteristics.
- Useful for discovering natural groupings within datasets.

### Spatial Autocorrelation
- Assesses the similarity of data points in geographic space.
- Helps identify spatial patterns and dependencies.

### Spatial Econometrics
- Combines economic models with spatial analysis techniques.
- Accounts for spatial dependencies and effects in economic data.

### Decision Trees
- Machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks.
- Creates a tree-like model of decisions and their consequences.
